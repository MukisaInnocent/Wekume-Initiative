# Background Images

Add images to this folder to have them automatically appear in the home page background slideshow.

* Supported formats: .jpg, .jpeg, .png, .webp
* Images will be displayed in random or alphabetical order depending on the implementation.
* For best results, use high-resolution images (e.g., 1920x1080).











crop the lina-logo.pgn Icon to remove the invalid background. the unwanted background should be clearly removed and all contents in the icon should not be touched. Only the surrounding should be touched.
